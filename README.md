# Python-Graded-Exercises-for-Programming-and-Scripting

These are the 6 exercises which I have been completing over the last two months as part of my Programming and Scripting Module while completing the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics in GMIT.


##Week 1 and Week 2 Exercises in a single file named "fib-surname.py"

 In the video lectures this week we ran an example program that calculated the 30th Fibonacci number. Change the program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on. For example, my name is Ian, so I should calculate the 25th Fibonacci number because I is 9 and n is 14, giving 25 in total. Once you calculate the right Fibonacci number for your own name, please post it to the Discussions forum on this page as per my post there. Ex2. Copy and run the program yourself. Change the string variable to contain your own surname, and rerun it. Can you figure out what ord() does? Try to Google it to find out. Post the output of the program, along with any insight you have as to what ord() does, to the discussions forum.
 
##Week 3 Exercise 3 - file "collatz.py" 

In the video lectures we discussed the Collatz conjecture. Complete the exercise discussed in the Collatz conjecture video by writing a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer should be printed to the screen. You can specify in your code the starting value of 17. If you wish to enhance your program, have the program ask the user for the integer instead of specifying a value at the start of your code. Add the script to your GitHub repository, as per the instruction in the Assessments section.

##Week 5 Exercise 4 - Project Euler Problem 5 

It is problem 5 from Project Euler. The problem is as follows. 2,520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. Write a Python program using for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20. Add your answer to your GitHub repository. 


##Week 6 Exercise 5 - Open file and format output file "openfile.py" 

Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.
